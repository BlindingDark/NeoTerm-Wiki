## Overview

NeoTerm is a modern designed android terminal emulator for the 21st century, which provides both graphical and command line package manager, and many packages for daily use and development.

## Our Pledge
Originally, NeoTerm was designed as the front end of Termux to provide some functions that Termux didn't have, but we found it very convenient. In continuous development, we discovered our goal: to be the best terminal for Android.
